Coordinates tasks, timelines, and team communication. Facilitates Agile ceremonies, removes blockers, and ensures alignment with project goals. Tracks progress and fosters collaboration across roles.


## Database Design

This section outlines the core entities and relationships in the AirBnB Clone backend system. The database is designed to support user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.

### ðŸ‘¤ Users
Represents individuals using the platform, either as hosts or guests.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (e.g., host, guest)

**Relationships:**
- A user can list multiple properties.
- A user can make multiple bookings.
- A user can leave multiple reviews.

---

### Properties
Represents accommodations listed by hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `host_id` (Foreign Key -> Users)

**Relationships:**
- A property belongs to one host (user).
- A property can have multiple bookings.
- A property can have multiple reviews.

---

### Bookings
Represents reservations made by guests.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key â†’ Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key â†’ Properties)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`

**Relationships:**
- A booking is made by one user.
- A booking is for one property.
- A booking may be linked to a payment.

---

### Reviews
Represents feedback left by users about properties.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key -> Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key -> Properties)
- `rating` (e.g., 1â€“5)
- `comment`

**Relationships:**
- A review is written by one user.
- A review is about one property.

---

### Payments
Represents financial transactions for bookings.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key -> Bookings)
- `amount`
- `payment_method`
- `status` (e.g., pending, completed)

**Relationships:**
- A payment is linked to one booking.

This relational structure supports scalability, data integrity, and efficient querying for core platform features.


## Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features implemented in the AirBnB Clone project. Each feature is designed to replicate key functionalities of the original platform while showcasing backend development, testing, and deployment skills.

### User Management
Handles user registration, authentication, and role-based access control. Supports secure login using hashed passwords and distinguishes between hosts and guests for personalized experiences.

### Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details such as title, description, location, and availability, enabling guests to browse and book accommodations.

### Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates. Includes conflict detection, booking history, and integration with payment processing to simulate real-world reservation workflows.

### Review System
Allows users to leave ratings and comments on properties theyâ€™ve stayed in. Helps build trust and transparency by surfacing feedback from previous guests.

### Payment Integration
Simulates payment processing for bookings using mock transactions. Tracks payment status, method, and amount, laying the foundation for future integration with real payment gateways.

### Authentication & Authorization
Implements secure login and access control using JWT or OAuth2. Ensures that only authorized users can perform actions based on their roles (e.g., host vs guest).

### CI/CD & Deployment
Automates testing and deployment using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Terraform. Supports scalable cloud deployment and infrastructure as code for reproducible environments.

### Monitoring & Logging (Optional)
Integrates Prometheus and Grafana for system metrics and observability. Helps track uptime, performance, and error rates to support future SRE practices.

## API Security

Securing backend APIs is critical to protecting user data, maintaining system integrity, and ensuring trust in the platform. This section outlines the key security measures implemented in the AirBnB Clone project and explains their importance across different areas.

### Authentication
We use secure authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2 to verify user identity. This ensures that only registered users can access protected resources and perform actions based on their roles.

**Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive user data and personal information.

---

### Authorization
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., host, guest, admin). Each API endpoint checks permissions before executing operations.

**Why it matters**: Ensures users can only perform actions theyâ€™re allowed to, protecting property data and booking workflows.

---

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests per user/IP within a time window. Tools like Flask-Limiter or API Gateway throttling are used.

**Why it matters**: Protects the system from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures fair usage of resources.

---

### ðŸ”’ Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt). Communication between client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.

**Why it matters**: Prevents data leaks and protects user credentials and payment information during transmission.

---

### Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Framework-level protections and custom validators are used.

**Why it matters**: Ensures system integrity and protects against malicious payloads.

---

### Secure Payments (Simulated)
Although real payment gateways are not integrated, mock transactions are handled securely with proper status tracking and user verification.

**Why it matters**: Builds a foundation for future integration with real payment systems and protects financial workflows.

---

These security measures collectively ensure that the AirBnB Clone backend is resilient, trustworthy, and ready for real-world deployment.
