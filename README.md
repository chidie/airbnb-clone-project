# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview

This repository contains the AirBnB Clone project, a backend-focused implementation inspired by the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform. The goal is to build a scalable, modular, and testable system that supports user management, property listings, bookings, and reviews all through a RESTful API.

This project is part of the ALX Pro Dev Software Engineering (Backend) program and serves as a hands-on exercise in backend architecture, API design, and DevOps practices.
