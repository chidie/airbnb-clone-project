# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview

This repository contains the AirBnB Clone project, a backend-focused implementation inspired by the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform. The goal is to build a scalable, modular, and testable system that supports user management, property listings, bookings, and reviews all through a RESTful API.

This project is part of the ALX Pro Dev Software Engineering (Backend) program and serves as a hands-on exercise in backend architecture, API design, and DevOps practices.

## Project Goals

- Build a robust backend system using Python and Flask
- Implement RESTful APIs for core AirBnB features
- Integrate automated testing and CI/CD pipelines
- Deploy the application using Docker and cloud-native tools
- Practice infrastructure as code and monitoring strategies

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Django
- **Database**: MySQL or SQLite (depending on environment)
- **Testing**: Unittest, Robot Framework
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: AWS (EC2, S3, or Lambda), Terraform
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana (optional)
- **Version Control**: Git

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Roles

This section outlines the key roles and responsibilities within the AirBnB Clone project. Each role contributes to building a scalable, reliable, and user-friendly backend system.

### Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the core application logic, RESTful APIs, and server-side functionality. Ensures code quality, modularity, and performance. Collaborates with other roles to integrate features and maintain system reliability.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the database schema, relationships, indexing, and performance tuning. Ensures data integrity, backups, and secure access. Works closely with backend developers to optimize queries and support multi-tenant architecture.

### QA/Test Automation Engineer
Designs and maintains automated test suites using tools like Robot Framework, Cypress, and Unittest. Validates functionality, performance, and edge cases. Integrates testing into CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous quality.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and cloud deployment strategies (AWS, Terraform). Automates infrastructure provisioning and monitors system health. Ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and fast delivery cycles.

### SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)
Focuses on system reliability, observability, and incident response. Implements monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana), defines SLIs/SLOs, and conducts chaos testing. Bridges development and operations to maintain uptime and performance.

### Project Manager / Scrum Master
Coordinates tasks, timelines, and team communication. Facilitates Agile ceremonies, removes blockers, and ensures alignment with project goals. Tracks progress and fosters collaboration across roles.


## Database Design

This section outlines the core entities and relationships in the AirBnB Clone backend system. The database is designed to support user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.

### ðŸ‘¤ Users
Represents individuals using the platform, either as hosts or guests.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (e.g., host, guest)

**Relationships:**
- A user can list multiple properties.
- A user can make multiple bookings.
- A user can leave multiple reviews.

---

### Properties
Represents accommodations listed by hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `host_id` (Foreign Key -> Users)

**Relationships:**
- A property belongs to one host (user).
- A property can have multiple bookings.
- A property can have multiple reviews.

---

### Bookings
Represents reservations made by guests.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key â†’ Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key â†’ Properties)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`

**Relationships:**
- A booking is made by one user.
- A booking is for one property.
- A booking may be linked to a payment.

---

### Reviews
Represents feedback left by users about properties.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key -> Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key -> Properties)
- `rating` (e.g., 1â€“5)
- `comment`

**Relationships:**
- A review is written by one user.
- A review is about one property.

---

### Payments
Represents financial transactions for bookings.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key -> Bookings)
- `amount`
- `payment_method`
- `status` (e.g., pending, completed)

**Relationships:**
- A payment is linked to one booking.

---

This relational structure supports scalability, data integrity, and efficient querying for core platform features.
