# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview

This repository contains the AirBnB Clone project, a backend-focused implementation inspired by the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform. The goal is to build a scalable, modular, and testable system that supports user management, property listings, bookings, and reviews all through a RESTful API.

This project is part of the ALX Pro Dev Software Engineering (Backend) program and serves as a hands-on exercise in backend architecture, API design, and DevOps practices.

## Project Goals

- Build a robust backend system using Python and Flask
- Implement RESTful APIs for core AirBnB features
- Integrate automated testing and CI/CD pipelines
- Deploy the application using Docker and cloud-native tools
- Practice infrastructure as code and monitoring strategies

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: MySQL or SQLite (depending on environment)
- **Testing**: Unittest, Robot Framework
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: AWS (EC2, S3, or Lambda), Terraform
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana (optional)
- **Version Control**: Git

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Roles

This section outlines the key roles and responsibilities within the AirBnB Clone project. Each role contributes to building a scalable, reliable, and user-friendly backend system.

### Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the core application logic, RESTful APIs, and server-side functionality. Ensures code quality, modularity, and performance. Collaborates with other roles to integrate features and maintain system reliability.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the database schema, relationships, indexing, and performance tuning. Ensures data integrity, backups, and secure access. Works closely with backend developers to optimize queries and support multi-tenant architecture.

### QA/Test Automation Engineer
Designs and maintains automated test suites using tools like Robot Framework, Cypress, and Unittest. Validates functionality, performance, and edge cases. Integrates testing into CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous quality.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and cloud deployment strategies (AWS, Terraform). Automates infrastructure provisioning and monitors system health. Ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and fast delivery cycles.

### SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)
Focuses on system reliability, observability, and incident response. Implements monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana), defines SLIs/SLOs, and conducts chaos testing. Bridges development and operations to maintain uptime and performance.

### Project Manager / Scrum Master
Coordinates tasks, timelines, and team communication. Facilitates Agile ceremonies, removes blockers, and ensures alignment with project goals. Tracks progress and fosters collaboration across roles.
